# The Watson Customer Journey
This is meant to tell a story - a story about how typical customers discover, learn, and consume our Data and AI offerings. It should provide guidance and templates for typical documents and collateral that customers will find useful.  Do you have questions about typical use cases?  About good deployment models?  Others have asked these same questions before, why not learn from their experiences?  Life is a journey - your adoption of Watson and artificial intelligence is part of YOUR journey.

## Monitoring and Scaling
